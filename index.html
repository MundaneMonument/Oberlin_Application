	Dear Pipo<br/><br/>
	
	I am writing to express my great interest in the Visiting Assistant Professor for Integrated Media 
	that was posted on your site. As you can see from my CV, I have experience teaching both in traditional 
	and new media. My own experience in art has taught me to combine video, net-art, archival arts, creative coding and 3D printing.
	<br/><br/>

	During the last semester I have taught four sections of a class on digital imaging and web-art. 
	It was a mandatory class in the first year program aimed at the introduction of both new types 
	of media and the idea of internet presence and citizenship. I developed all the classes which I taught. 
	Most students have never thought of their computer as a productive tool, 
	and this realization and the new uses they found were fascinating and enlightening.
	In the previous year, I have assisted students in various classes, both frontal art history seminars and project based classes. 
	I was a teacher's assistant to Prehistory of New Media that explored the history of New Media and code art prior to 
	the title origin in the 1980's. 
	I also assisted graduate level seminar on experimental approaches to writing and 
	taking writing off the page in which I was exposed to various methods of collaborations. 
	I also learned teaching techniques to incorporate difficult texts into a project oriented seminar.   
	<br/><br/>
	As an artist I am interested in the relationship between the body and its inanimate environment. 
	This interest led me to an MFA at SAICâ€™s Department of Art and Technology Studies. 
	 During the program I was exposed both to 3D printing and creative coding. I have developed my practice to 
	 deal with new forms of relating to space and objects in my environment. 
	 I have, as can be seen in my work, developed an interest in impossible conversations that 
	 question the ability to comprehend the world. For example, I facilitated a series of 
	 private conversation with the stars that were broadcasted to outer space with a hacked ham radio. 
	 <br/><br/>

	I am applying to the job since my interest 
	in new ways to look at the world and finding out that teaching is 
	an amazing way to both expose new ways and meet new outlooks.
	<br/><br/>

	Thank you for your consideration.<br/>
	Best regards,<br/>
	Guy Eytan
