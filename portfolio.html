		<b><u> Pornographic Nature </b></u><br/>
		2014<br/>
		Video, 10:40 <br/>
		The video is made from found footage taken from the dead times in porn movies: shots of scenery and atmosphere. 
		Not a single person is shown. A voice over reads in a British lilt a text about the beauty and importance of forgetting, 
		taking quotes from different sources trying to make a case for forgetting. <br/>
		All the footage is taken from websites that are held by ThinkGeek corporation. <br/>
		The length is the length of an average visit to Pornhub.<br/>
		The full video can be seen <a href="http://guyeytan.com/see#/id/v131444"><u>here.</u></a><br/>

		Vinyl, antique rake heads, text <br/>
		An ongoing performance in which I wear the harness with the rake heads attached, <br/>
		attempting to systematically walk the entire grid of Chicago starting from the 0/0 point (State and Madison) <br/>
		The rakes slowly grind away.<br/>
		The only documentation is the objects collected by the rakes, <br/>
		bits of texts about the conversations along the road, and the echo bouncing from the buildings. <br/>
		
		An example of a days text can be read <u><a href="http://guyeytan.com/performative-subjects#/id/i5915999"> here </a></u>

		Chair, text <br/>
		The text in the gallery was exhibited as a small triangular plaque in a corner. <br/>
		In order to read it, the viewer had to sit in a chair facing the wall.<br/>
		Thus the viewer was recreating the situation that "killed" me.

		<u><b>Wine/Light/Incarnate</b></u><br/>
		2010 <br/>
		Fifteen wine glasses are set in a row on the floor.<br/> 
		They are arranged in a gradient from pure red wine to pure white wine. An energy saving light bulb sits in each glass. <br/>
		The electricity cables hang down from the ceiling. <br/>
		The room slowly fills up with the smell of the wine evaporating.<br/>
		The usually harsh light of the light bulbs is filtered and warmed by the shade of the wine.

		<u><b>How To Become One with a Monument</b></u><br/>
		2014 <br/>
		Performance <br/>
		The city of Chicago is renowned for its monumental architecture.<br/>
		I, as a foreigner in the city, feel both in awe and excluded by the monuments<br/>
		In a series of performances I try to attach myself to the monuments using osmosis.<br/>
		The band is there in order to keep the head locked in place, always touching the monument.<br/>
		Each performance ended when I was asked what I was doing or asked to leave <br/>

		<u><b>Spacial Problems</b></u><br/>
		2014 <br/>
		Radio transmission, digital prints <br/>
		In 2003 a radio transmission was sent to 6 planets that are presumed that they might hold life. 
		Into this message I have inserted a Rosetta Stone about language. 
		The writing is in a font that I made specifically for this project. 
		The original message ends with a series of questions about the the receivers, 
		I have replaced those questions with personal messages by people surveyed for this project. 
		The project revolves around unseen transmission, I try to render the invisible into the visual. 
		This is the first attempt made in studio. 
		The print outs of the first 15 people that answered the survey were weaved ceiling. 
		The final step in the first stage of the project will be building a transmitter to send the answered to space.

		<u><b>Treated Space</b></u><br/>
		2014 <br/>
		Vinyl, foam, wine glasses <br/>
		The entire room is covered in neutral grey vinyl.
		 Cupping therapy is applied to the second skin of the walls. 
		 The treatment ends when the walls decide, throwing the cups to the ground. 
		 The floor next to the walls is covered with vinyl and foam tiles made especially to catch the falling cups.
